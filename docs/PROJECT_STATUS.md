## What Was Accomplished

### Root Directory - Final State (6 files)

```
VoiceClick/
├── .gitignore              # Git configuration
├── app.py                  # Main application entry
├── monitor.py              # Progress widget launcher
├── PROJECT_ROADMAP.md      # 30-task development roadmap
├── README.md               # Project overview
└── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
```

**Result:** Clean, minimal, professional root directory
